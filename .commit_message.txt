feat: Refactor main.js to use async/await and update dependencies

This commit introduces several improvements:
- Updated `sequelize` to the latest stable version.
- Updated `dotenv`, `fast-xml-parser`, `node-telegram-bot-api`, and `sharp` to their latest versions.
- Replaced synchronous `sleep.sleep()` with asynchronous `setTimeout` for non-blocking operations.
- Replaced synchronous `fs.unlinkSync` with asynchronous `fs.promises.unlink`.
- Refactored `main.js` to use `async/await` for better readability and error handling, eliminating nested `.then()` calls.
- Used `path.join` for robust path concatenation.
- Extracted "magic number" for two hours into a named constant.
